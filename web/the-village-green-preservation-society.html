<h3>Ray Davies and The Kinks</h3>


<p class="theme"><em>Theme: <a href='humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a>, <a href='society.html' rel='tag'>society</a></em></p>

<p>This is a rather amazing song by The Kinks, first released in 1968.</p>
<p>I loved this song from the moment I first heard it, but my appreciation for it has only grown over the years.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the same year that John Lennon and Yoko Ono released an album called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_Music_No._1:_Two_Virgins"><em>Two Virgins</em></a> (certainly using the term to refer to themselves metaphorically, not literally), with an album cover showing the two artists completely naked, Ray Davies wrote a song with the immortal line, &ldquo;God save little shops, china cups and virginity&rdquo; (and Davies, to be clear,  delivered this line quite seriously and quite literally);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year before Jefferson Airplane released its album <em>Volunteers</em>, delivering the injunction &ldquo;Got to revolution,&rdquo; and noting that &ldquo;One generation got old, one generation got soul,&rdquo; Ray Davies was singing &ldquo;God save the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross">George Cross</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_George_Cross_recipients">all those who were awarded them</a>&rdquo;;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just one year after The Beatles released &ldquo;Penny Lane,&rdquo; an endearing song of sentimental childhood nostalgia, Ray Davies fashioned a song that used references to traditional English items, and fading elements of popular culture, not just for a walk down memory lane, but as part of an enduring anthem upholding the value of social continuity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lyrics are a treat all on their own, but the music adds a whole &rsquo;nother dimension to it, so be sure to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-village-green-preservation-society/1142638349?i=1142638545">listen</a> as well as read.</p>

<p>God save the Village Green!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the song exhibits many of the same virtues that it extols, being itself small, carefully crafted and unassuming.</p>
<p>There are a number of elements of this song that I find remarkable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on social unity, created through the repetition of the phrases &ldquo;We are&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;God save the&hellip;&rdquo; as well as by the understated, smoothly harmonizing vocals from the band members;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on critical elements of social progress: preserving the old ways, while still protecting the new ways;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on humanizing our society, both by respect for the inexplicable quirks of popular culture, as well as buildings designed for humans, rather than large institutions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on common action, created through the various different types of organizations cited, and even drawing the listener in through the concluding question, &ldquo;What more can we do?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thematically, the song can easily be thought of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana">George Santayana</a> set to music. Here are some similar thoughts, from his 1906 work, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NW369m"><em>The Life of Reason: Reason in Common Sense</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained &hellip; infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song seems even more relevant today than when it was first released, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As growing environmental issues have us all watching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of the commons</a> playing out on a global scale, we can see The Kinks&rsquo; concern for saving the village green in a new light;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we see England, America and other countries facing increasing polarization dividing their urban and rural populations, we can appreciate the value of Davies&rsquo; respect for traditional, village life;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we observe the terrible toll on our society taken by tech companies whose motto is &ldquo;Move fast and break things,&rdquo; we can gain new respect for the singers&rsquo; avowed mission of &ldquo;Preserving the old ways from being abused&rdquo; and &ldquo;Protecting the new ways, for me and for you.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ray Davies and The Kinks certainly recorded a number of great songs, but this one, I think, really stands alone for me. It&rsquo;s hard to think of a comparable song, from any artist, that so calls upon us as listeners to knit together the splintered pieces of our society into a coherent whole that works for all of us.</p>
<p>What more, indeed, can we ask an artist to do?</p>
