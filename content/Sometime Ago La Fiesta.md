The lyrics to this thing are pretty simple. 

Sometime ago  
I had a dream  
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free.

And now in life,   
Oh, can't you see  
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the music, it was playing.  
Oh, the firelight, it was dancing.  
All the children, they were singing.  
All the people, they were loving.  

Sometime ago   
I had a dream  
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free.

And now in life,   
Oh, can't you see  
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the morning sun, it was soft and cool.  
Oh, the evening breeze, it was warm and gold.  
All together life had started to unfold,
Sometime ago.
