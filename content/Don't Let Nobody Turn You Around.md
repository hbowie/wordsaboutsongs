Album: Your Saving Grace

Teaser: 
 
In this next series of songs, I'm going to highlight some that provide hope and strength in the face of societal adversity. (I might tag these with the theme of "resistance" if that hadn't become such an overused term lately.) 

I've always found this song from the Steve Miller Band to be uplifting and inspiring. The lyrics are pretty simple, but their effect is amplified by their musical delivery. And even though the whole track clocks in at under two -and-a-half minutes, there's a lot going on here.

In this next series of songs, I'm going to highlight some that provide hope and strength in the face of societal adversity. (I might tag these with the theme of "resistance" if that hadn't become such an overused term lately.) 

I've always found this song from the Steve Miller Band to be uplifting and inspiring. The lyrics are pretty simple, but their effect is amplified by their musical delivery. And even though the whole track clocks in at under two -and-a-half minutes, there's a lot going on here. 

Miller launches directly into the first verse, with solo vocals, drums and restrained instrumentation in the background, all played to a quick, rousing rhythm. 

> Well don't you let nobody turn you 'round,   
> Turn you 'round, turn you 'round.   
> Well don't you let nobody turn you 'round,   
> You got to keep on walkin', keep on talkin',   
> Marchin' to the freedom land.

We now get a biting guitar break from Miller, with nothing but drums in the background. 

The next verse adds backup vocals behind Miller for all of the words other than "nobody," which is still sung solo by Miller. The only instrumental backup for this verse are the omnipresent drums. 

> Well don't you let nobody turn you 'round,   
> Turn you 'round, turn you 'round,   
> Well don't you let nobody turn you 'round.   
> You got to keep on walkin', keep on talkin',   
> Marchin' to the freedom land.

The band now goes straight into the next verse, but now adding a great churning, striving bass line underneath it all. 

> Well don't you let the policeman turn you 'round,   
> Turn you 'round, turn you 'round.   
> Well don't let the policeman turn you 'round,   
> You got to keep on walkin', keep on talkin',   
> Marchin' to the freedom land.

Proceeding directly to the next verse, the band now pulls out all the stops, with background vocals and all of the instruments going at once. 

> Well don't let the politician turn you 'round,   
> Slow you down, slow you down.   
> Well don't let the politician slow you down,   
> You got to keep on walkin', keep on talkin',   
> Marchin' to the freedom land.

Now we get another great guitar break before the next verse, again backed only by drums. 

Full instrumentation and backing vocals are brought to bear on the next verse, as they were with the last one. 

> Well don't you let the army general burn the world,   
> Burn the world, burn the world.   
> Well don't let the army general burn this world,   
> You got to keep on walkin', keep on talkin',   
> Marchin' to the freedom land.

And now to the final verse, with full instrumentation and everyone's vocals on every word this time. 

> Well don't you let nobody turn you 'round,   
> Turn you 'round, turn you 'round.   
> Well don't you let nobody turn you 'round,   
> You got to keep on walkin', keep on talkin',   
> Marchin' to the freedom land.

Now the songs closes as quickly as it opened, although with a nice little ending in which you can distinctly hear keyboards and a single voice continuing after all the other noise stops, seemingly reminding us of the real individuals in the studio who have been at work here. 

I love the way this song builds over its course. The first verse sounds like a direct and personal plea from the singer to the listener, but by the last verse it feels like we're all marching and singing together, with the power to overcome all of the obstacles that have been named along the way. 

I should mention that another song with the same title appears on many gospel recordings, and it seems that some of the feel of Miller's song comes from this influence, even if the lyrics are mostly different. 

Interesting to note, of course, that this song, first released in 1969, seems as relevant for many of us today as it did nearly fifty years ago.
